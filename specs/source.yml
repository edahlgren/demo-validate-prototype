# source_spec.yml: Description of the 'source' section in a demo.yml file

# Fields:
#
#   + The 'doc' field:           Description of a field in a demo.yml file
#
#   + The 'constraints' field:   A list of constraints on a field. See about.md
#                                for definitions of constraints
#
#   + The 'content' field:       Separates 'doc' and 'constraints' from real
#                                fields in a demo.yml file. May not exist if
#                                the content of a field is trivial (e.g. String)
#                                or can be described by constraints (e.g. Array,
#                                contains-String)
